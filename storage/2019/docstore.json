BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We\n\ndevelop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cRides Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants (\u201cRestaurant(s)\u201d) and food delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for meal preparation and delivery services.

We also connect consumers with public transportation networks, e-bikes, e-scooters and other personal mobility options. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers\n\nin\n\nthe freight industry. We are also developing technologies that will provide autonomous driving vehicle solutions to consumers, networks of vertical take-off and landing vehicles and new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is\n\navailable in\n\n69\n\ncountries\n\naround the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).", "start_char_idx": 10615, "end_char_idx": 13012, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b3eaa70-eb37-4af5-b5c4-aebf20f7e16f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b3eaa70-eb37-4af5-b5c4-aebf20f7e16f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "763dc53e-8faf-42b0-a530-395cc1645467", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f036305-f603-4884-8ddb-495f97e3c8a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "2613b174686f748d716cd3094cda7a25b21b2399187bef3e33af4a8f993e5b96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9d8cd36-b1f6-4cc5-a9ed-3c365b1c9352", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2efea362a1757265db19c00c7f40d4c0ecf559e36efb12f55fdf2277c9cfd49f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Rides Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201c\n\nDriver(s)\n\n\u201d.

Rides, Eats, Freight and Other Bets platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. ATG and Other Technology Programs is focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.\n\nRides\n\nRides refers to products that connect consumers with Rides Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Rides Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.", "start_char_idx": 12166, "end_char_idx": 14652, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9d8cd36-b1f6-4cc5-a9ed-3c365b1c9352": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9d8cd36-b1f6-4cc5-a9ed-3c365b1c9352", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "763dc53e-8faf-42b0-a530-395cc1645467", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b3eaa70-eb37-4af5-b5c4-aebf20f7e16f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "b496b0fe906d30ee75d7d2da304ca006affbfe230e3ea16acb4caa84b212a481", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0dbc37d-2818-41dc-8de9-c4363ae88766", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "153478ceb6f79879649078d31ccc089a05746266e4b55cd6e5a19ce4d76f88ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.

At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nEats\n\nOur Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. We launched our Eats app over four years ago. We believe that Eats not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times. Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Rides Drivers or who do not have access to Rides-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Eats provides Restaurants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Restaurants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. In October 2019, we announced a majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.", "start_char_idx": 13621, "end_char_idx": 16195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0dbc37d-2818-41dc-8de9-c4363ae88766": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0dbc37d-2818-41dc-8de9-c4363ae88766", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "763dc53e-8faf-42b0-a530-395cc1645467", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9d8cd36-b1f6-4cc5-a9ed-3c365b1c9352", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "8934a1a65e390e10b690946e9a34a990279758ed784b380156f8062a6de0e864", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82a4288e-2beb-4066-bc56-f7b9238f36bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce55fc98ff76d18550751a8168e8fd8d9ad4edd7d134e0e7695b3ecf37ecf075", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand\n\nplatform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nIn March 2019, we announced the expansion of our Freight offering into Europe.", "start_char_idx": 15236, "end_char_idx": 17938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82a4288e-2beb-4066-bc56-f7b9238f36bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "82a4288e-2beb-4066-bc56-f7b9238f36bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "763dc53e-8faf-42b0-a530-395cc1645467", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0dbc37d-2818-41dc-8de9-c4363ae88766", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "429202cf2fc785bd5cfc29a425efbd8f00d6f73f4ef9e87aebbbfc001ea1e99d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e335f0b-be10-4626-b37e-cf1acef7dfb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4dff94ce28a99d9a906c2b248aba7e7a2dcf4a77d96e896a1eb3577bb3194e8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

The largest investment within the segment is our New Mobility offering that refers to products that provide consumers with access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). New Mobility also includes Transit, UberWorks and our Platform Incubator group, which is responsible for innovating new services and use cases on our platform to drive long-term growth and cross-platform customer engagement.\n\nWe are investing in new modes of transportation that enable us to address a wider range of consumer use cases and represent a significant opportunity to bring additional trips onto our platform. We believe that dockless e-bikes and e-scooters address many of these use cases and will replace a portion of these vehicle trips over time, particularly in urban environments that suffer from substantial traffic during peak commuting hours.\n\nATG and Other Technology Programs\n\nThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.\n\nATG focuses on developing autonomous vehicle technologies, which we believe have the long-term potential to provide safer and more efficient rides and deliveries to consumers, as well as lower prices.", "start_char_idx": 16941, "end_char_idx": 19579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e335f0b-be10-4626-b37e-cf1acef7dfb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e335f0b-be10-4626-b37e-cf1acef7dfb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "763dc53e-8faf-42b0-a530-395cc1645467", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "82a4288e-2beb-4066-bc56-f7b9238f36bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "7b975a8bef70a8657035519181331536adc4ba2610001f4cccad4266828d98bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8720ee5d-0c55-4707-a0de-7e45967913fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e45d2bc0dcb9538b3832a85109468cfed9e47fc2c2dd62149ef084b95d8afc0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "New Mobility also includes Transit, UberWorks and our Platform Incubator group, which is responsible for innovating new services and use cases on our platform to drive long-term growth and cross-platform customer engagement.\n\nWe are investing in new modes of transportation that enable us to address a wider range of consumer use cases and represent a significant opportunity to bring additional trips onto our platform.

Along the way to a potential future autonomous vehicle world, we believe that there will be a long period of hybrid autonomy, in which autonomous vehicles will be deployed gradually against specific use cases while Drivers continue to serve most consumer demand. As we solve specific autonomous use cases, we will deploy autonomous vehicles against them. Such situations may include trips along a standard, well-mapped route in a predictable environment in good weather. In other situations, such as those that involve substantial traffic, complex routes, or unusual weather conditions, we will continue to rely on Drivers. Accordingly, we believe that we will be uniquely suited for this dynamic phase during the expected long hybrid period of co-existence of Drivers and autonomous vehicles. Drivers are therefore a critical and differentiating advantage for us and will continue to be an advantage in the long term. We plan to continue to partner with original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), other suppliers, such as Toyota and DENSO, and other technology companies to determine how to most effectively leverage our network during the transition to autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nPlatform Synergies\n\nOur Platform\n\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.

The majority of our Ridesharing products in the EU currently operate under licensing regimes where one or more of Drivers, vehicles, or we are required to register or hold licenses to provide services.

For example, in California, State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in\n\nDynamex Operations v. Superior Court\n\nin 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.

Insurance expenses include coverage for auto liability, general liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist liability, and auto physical damage related to our Rides products and Eats offering. Excess Driver incentives are primarily related to our Rides products in emerging markets and our Eats offering.\n\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent we continue to see growth on the platform.

The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.\n\nUpon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these\n\nConvertible Notes\n\nelected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.

These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted-average cost of capital, and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows.
