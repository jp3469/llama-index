On December 7, 2020, we announced the sale of Apparate USA LLC (\u201cATG Business\u201d or \u201cApparate\u201d), our subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technologies, to Aurora Innovation, Inc. (\u201cAurora\u201d). Our ATG Business is included within our ATG and Other Technology Programs segment. On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora.\n\nMobility\n\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, Transit and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem Inc.", "start_char_idx": 13507, "end_char_idx": 15936, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97d377be-5797-46a0-95c2-8d10183418af": {"__data__": {"id_": "97d377be-5797-46a0-95c2-8d10183418af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdbb7b9-4437-43b4-b8e9-0fdfc187be41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e529ff21fa2b66e57501f64ff7983ac40e2a1d0c8e28f658b03458b65278ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8927f7c9-c733-45fc-975e-ad56b6679d60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "091ab0216b648d94d0a27ab60cfb4e7a238c1910440837bdc05d9553908929ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "99dc1c79-ca41-48a3-bba6-5e315ec3b18b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51749c659be1066846027fe4c7ae98bf5d00cde87d5df3effa189ddf184195c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms.

(\u201cCareem\u201d). Dubai-based Careem was founded in 2012, and provides primarily ridesharing and payments services to millions of users in cities across the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan.

We launched our Delivery app over five years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2020, we received regulatory approvals to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\"Cornershop\u201d\"), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.", "start_char_idx": 16602, "end_char_idx": 19177, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aefd1957-4b59-470a-9d68-584bd8dac599": {"__data__": {"id_": "aefd1957-4b59-470a-9d68-584bd8dac599", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdbb7b9-4437-43b4-b8e9-0fdfc187be41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e529ff21fa2b66e57501f64ff7983ac40e2a1d0c8e28f658b03458b65278ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99dc1c79-ca41-48a3-bba6-5e315ec3b18b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "17a3c6763f1e0d0b5af30ca230db07cfd2a67b1a96096a1c3c47f5787f6a12cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "784770a7-e51a-4831-ba85-3fddd703356c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e6d8cdac6609dda39b837f0af5f3d84565ccfc1b67904654838b0883250cb7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Freight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.

Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nATG and Other Technology Programs\n\nThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.

Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, GrubHub, Deliveroo, Glovo, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation.

However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies from country to country, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, and recently started to implement additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22, as described in more detail below.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).", "start_char_idx": 46468, "end_char_idx": 49137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0439ccd6-2030-4eac-bf79-c29525d45d71": {"__data__": {"id_": "0439ccd6-2030-4eac-bf79-c29525d45d71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdbb7b9-4437-43b4-b8e9-0fdfc187be41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e529ff21fa2b66e57501f64ff7983ac40e2a1d0c8e28f658b03458b65278ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "114d74d0-4fb1-43cd-a44e-4b8db64a91a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b78295e500aabb7a45e55cc4368cb8f8c423a3017519a090aa55216e8f8454f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df49ba9c-adf0-4dea-bad0-dfac313954ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26f961c562468ed0216489da766be7e1ba8655a1f4b166fc94730fa5d651f353", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.

In addition to tips, Drivers using Uber\u2019s platform have earned over $133 billion from the end of 2015 through the end of 2020.\n\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. In 2020, Drivers enrolled in over 3,200 courses in continuing professional education (entrepreneurship and English language learning) and over 2,300 undergraduate courses with Arizona State University online through our Uber Pro program.\n\nAdvocacy: We have also advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.

Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees, including the California Attorney General\u2019s suit, remains pending, and we may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.", "start_char_idx": 396248, "end_char_idx": 399081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c7a22a3-c642-46a3-ae9f-447359de8553": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c7a22a3-c642-46a3-ae9f-447359de8553", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdbb7b9-4437-43b4-b8e9-0fdfc187be41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e529ff21fa2b66e57501f64ff7983ac40e2a1d0c8e28f658b03458b65278ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf9f6998-ab29-46d2-84ca-e6fc1e64777e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "4b95bc3933333ee3a7f874463c4c26dfc6fe3dde91a1641cd724d4f9470c57c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "26076229-bcf9-4500-9812-2a647d716349", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72d545d51ff3627ba1abd1ed355981e621e0e60f738e958b0e8fd92c632d9ea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers.

These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument.

We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\n\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date.

Developing the independent estimate\n\n84\n\ninvolved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costs. Testing management\u2019s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nSan Francisco,

Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAs our business has evolved, we believe our new presentation policy is preferable as it better reflects the financial performance of transactions with customers across all of our businesses and provides more clarity about changes in both revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, resulting in improved financial reporting and alignment with financial information used internally by management.\n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all periods presented below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the change to revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. There was no net impact to loss from operations, net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., or net income (loss) per share for any periods presented.

Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.

We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates.

The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique\n\nprimarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d) is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\n\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.

Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was applied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by $230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million, representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.", "start_char_idx": 555055, "end_char_idx": 557579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "515ff24a-8ba1-4849-a9cc-2ec85dabe04f": {"__data__": {"id_": "515ff24a-8ba1-4849-a9cc-2ec85dabe04f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdbb7b9-4437-43b4-b8e9-0fdfc187be41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e529ff21fa2b66e57501f64ff7983ac40e2a1d0c8e28f658b03458b65278ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c73c1286-6c76-470e-a27f-d3093c8dafef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "304899477daaa9989d6472e51d90dbf09d6564e4bb3de3d61b16503906cbb918", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "071dd7a5-823c-43e9-aab8-53132cbe5d5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "95b5db6c313e8dbfc98f7beacce75c08a92a6ebc46abe07b287e8cb71cca0f49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These observed inputs were considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities.

The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companies that have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration of impairments of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit. Also, during the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges to intangible assets of $23 million, property and equipment of $47 million and other current assets of $23 million in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in our New Mobility reporting unit.\n\nIn light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value. Based on an analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors, including market valuation multiples of public companies operating in the same business and considering the significant excess of the fair value attributable to the Mobility reporting unit over its carrying value, we determined that Mobility goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe performed an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.", "start_char_idx": 579817, "end_char_idx": 582192, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "689e1a86-2a1a-461e-b122-201ddd9c75f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "689e1a86-2a1a-461e-b122-201ddd9c75f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdbb7b9-4437-43b4-b8e9-0fdfc187be41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e529ff21fa2b66e57501f64ff7983ac40e2a1d0c8e28f658b03458b65278ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "632c5043-7d46-4b20-ab12-1d3181d56d14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "27e43ebd97483aff8eee8b562f3b75b4eb435ffe4b364ee74e36273fed5b9f89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78b20c28-a268-4851-a9f1-da3091d4f04f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8be1e1d66359cb072acf8256195ae6202e848e7816439a7bfc4777bae8712d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $9.9 billion and $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.

Levandowski\n\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to compete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March 26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against Anthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million.

Uber paid Google on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski. Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement. In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. The indemnification dispute and Levandowski\u2019s claim will proceed in the bankruptcy court. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the trade secret conviction. The ultimate resolution of the matter could result in a possible loss of up to $60 million or more (depending on interest incurred) in excess of the amount accrued.\n\nTaiwan Regulatory Fines\n\nPrior to us adjusting and re-launching our operating model in April 2017 to a model where government-approved rental companies provide transport services to Riders, Drivers in Taiwan and the local Uber entity were fined by Taiwan\u2019s Directorate General of Highways in significant numbers across Taiwan.
